          BUG REPORT
==============================
Title: [When the Millennium Falcon won't start and you’re stuck in hyperspace]
Date: [YYYY-MM-DD]
Reported by: [Han Solo / Your Name]
------------------------------
Description:
------------------------------
It seems the hyperdrive is malfunctioning again — the ship refuses to jump to lightspeed, leaving us drifting in the Outer Rim. Not cool, Chewie.
------------------------------
Steps to Reproduce:
------------------------------
1. Enter the cockpit.
2. Attempt to engage the hyperdrive by pressing the big red button.
3. Watch as nothing happens except the warning lights flashing like a disco.
------------------------------
Expected Result:
------------------------------
Hyperspace jump initiates smoothly, and we escape the Empire’s clutches.
------------------------------
Actual Result:
------------------------------
Ship stays put, hyperdrive fails spectacularly, and we get stuck like a Tauntaun on ice.
------------------------------
Environment:
------------------------------
- OS: Death Star Control System v1.0
- App: Millennium Falcon Cockpit Interface v2.7.3
- Device: Custom Corellian Engineering
------------------------------
Additional Notes:
------------------------------
- Chewbacca grumbled loudly after the failure.
- R2-D2 was unimpressed.
- Please fix before Darth Vader shows up.
