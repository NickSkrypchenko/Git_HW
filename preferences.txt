Favorite Movie: Interstellar — because space, time travel, and crying in the fifth dimension just hit different.
Favorite TV Show: Brooklyn Nine-Nine — for daily doses of chaos, sarcasm, and “noice” moments.
Favorite Food: Sushi — because raw fish never felt so classy.
Favorite Season: Autumn — hoodie weather + dramatic leaves = perfection.
Dream Travel Destination: Japan — for the culture, the ramen, and maybe a chance to pet a Shiba Inu on Mount Fuji.
