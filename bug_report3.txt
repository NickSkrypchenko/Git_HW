          BUG REPORT
==============================
Title: [Déjà vu – the cat glitched again]
Date: [YYYY-MM-DD]
Reported by: [Neo / Thomas A. Anderson]
------------------------------
Description:
------------------------------
While navigating the Matrix, a black cat walked past a doorway. A moment later, *the same cat* walked by again. Clearly a glitch. Agents appeared shortly after, confirming the simulation was being modified.
------------------------------
Steps to Reproduce:
------------------------------
1. Enter a simulated building inside the Matrix.
2. Observe a black cat walk by.
3. Wait two seconds.
4. Observe *the same* black cat repeat the action.
------------------------------
Expected Result:
------------------------------
Unique feline movement with no temporal anomalies.
------------------------------
Actual Result:
------------------------------
Identical black cat walks by twice. Time loop suspected. Agents breach simulation. Panic ensues.
------------------------------
Environment:
------------------------------
- OS: Matrix Mainframe v3.0
- App: Construct Viewer / Reality Layer Handler
- Device: Neuro-Interface Port (Model: Zion v7)
------------------------------
Additional Notes:
------------------------------
- Trinity confirmed visual duplicate.
- Morpheus says "it means they’ve changed something."
- Requesting patch to prevent minor glitches triggering full-scale ambushes.
- Recommend adding cat cache invalidation logic.
